4. Relevant Information:
     This is one of three domains provided by the Oncology Institute
     that has repeatedly appeared in the machine learning literature.
     (See also lymphography and primary-tumor.)

     This data set includes 201 instances of one class and 85 instances of
     another class.  The instances are described by 9 attributes, some of
     which are linear and some are nominal.

5. Number of Instances: 286

6. Number of Attributes: 9 + the class attribute

7. Attribute Information:
   1. Class: no-recurrence-events = 0, recurrence-events = 1
   2. age: 10-19 = 1, 20-29 = 2, 30-39 = 3, 40-49 = 4, 50-59 = 5, 60-69 = 6, 70-79 = 7, 80-89 = 8, 90-99 = 9.
   3. menopause: lt40 = 1, ge40 = 2, premeno = 3.
   4. tumor-size: 0-4 = 1, 5-9=2, 10-14=3, 15-19=4, 20-24=5, 25-29=6, 30-34=7, 35-39=8, 40-44=9,
