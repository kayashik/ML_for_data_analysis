A lasso regression analysis was conducted to identify a subset of variables from a pool of 9 categorical and
quantitative predictor variables that best predicted a quantitative response variable measuring breast cancer
recurrence. Categorical predictors included age, menopause, tumor size, number (range 0 - 39) of axillary lymph nodes,
Degree of malignancy, breast side and Breast quadrant to improve interpretability of the selectedmodel with fewer
predictors. Binary substance use variables were measured with individual questions about whether the patients have node
caps and used a radiation therapy.

Data were randomly split into a training set that included 70% of the observations and a test set that included
30% of the observations. The least angle regression algorithm with k=5 fold cross validation was used to
estimate the lasso regression model in the training set, and the model was validated using the test set. The change in
the cross validation average (mean) squared error at each step was used to identify the best subset of predictor
variables.

Of the 9 predictor variables, 4 were retained in the selected model. During the estimation process, Degree of malignancy
and node caps were most strongly associated with breast cancer recurrence, followed by tumor size and number of axillary
lymph nodes. All of this variables were positively associated with sbreast cancer recurrence.
