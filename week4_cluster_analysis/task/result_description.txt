A k-means cluster analysis was conducted to identify underlying subgroups of adolescents based on their similarity of
responses on 9 variables that represent characteristics that could have an impact breast cancer recurrence. Clustering
variables included two binary variables measuring whether or not the patients have node caps and used or not a radiation
therapy, as well as quantitative variables measuring age, menopause, tumor size, number (range 0 - 39) of axillary lymph
nodes, Degree of malignancy, breast side and Breast quadrant. All clustering variables were standardized to have a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Data were randomly split into a training set that included 70% of the observations  and a test set that included 30% of
the observations. A series of k-means cluster analyses were conducted on the training data specifying k=1-5 clusters,
using Euclidean distance. The variance in the clustering variables that was accounted for by the clusters (r-square) was
plotted for each of the five cluster solutions in an elbow curve to provide guidance for choosing the number of clusters
to interpret. (myplot2.png)

The elbow curve was inconclusive, suggesting that the 2-cluster solutions might be interpreted. The results below are
for an interpretation of the 2-cluster solution.

Canonical discriminant analyses was used to reduce the 5 clustering variable down a few variables that accounted for
most of the variance in the clustering variables. A scatterplot of the first two canonical variables by cluster
indicated that the observations in clusters 1 and 2 dont not overlap very much with each other. Cluster 2 was generally
distinct, but the observations had greater spread suggesting higher within cluster variance.
