Random forest analysis was performed to evaluate the importance of a series of explanatory variables in predicting a
binary, categorical response variable. The following explanatory variables were included as possible contributors to a
random forest evaluating breast cancer recurrence age, menopause, tumor size, number (range 0 - 39) of axillary lymph
nodes, Node caps, Degree of malignancy, Breast, Breast quadrant, Irradiation.

The explanatory variables with the highest relative importance scores were tumor size, Degree of malignancy, Breast
quadrant, age and number of axillary lymph nodes. The accuracy of the random forest was 75%, with the subsequent growing
of multiple trees rather than a single tree, adding 10% to the overall accuracy of the model, and suggesting that
interpretation of a 23 decision tree may be appropriate.
